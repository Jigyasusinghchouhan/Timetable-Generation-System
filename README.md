# Timetable Generation System (TTGS)

## Configuration Setup

**To run this project on your local server, follow the following
steps:**

`pip install Django`
`pip install django-crispy-forms`
`pip install django-multiselectfield`
`python manage.py runserver`

# Introduction:
 The introduction of the Timetable Generation System (TTGS) signifies a response to the intricate scheduling demands encountered by educational institutions, particularly in the creation of academic timetables. This web-based application is crafted to alleviate the challenges associated with manual timetable generation, aiming to automate and optimize the process. The decision to embark on this project is motivated by the inefficiencies inherent in traditional manual scheduling methods and the complexities posed by various constraints in educational timetabling.TTGS aims to streamline the labor-intensive and error-prone nature of
manual timetable creation by leveraging the power of the Genetic Algorithm (GA). The GA serves as the cornerstone of the system, offering an efficient approach to generating conflict-free timetables while accommodating both hard and soft constraints. This introduction sets the stage for understanding the objectives of TTGS, addressing the need for automation, optimization, and improved resource allocation in academic scheduling.


# Conclusion: 
The Timetable Generation System (TTGS) addresses the challenges ofmanual timetable creation in educational institutions. By leveraging thepower of the Genetic Algorithm and utilizing web technologies, TTGSprovides an efficient and user-friendly solution to optimize resourceallocation and streamline the scheduling process.
